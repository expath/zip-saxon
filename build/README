                                README



  This is an open-source implementation of the EXPath ZIP Facility
module[1].  It is hosted at Google Code[2].  It is packaged as a XAR
file, that is a package that can be automatically deployed in a local
repository.

  To install this package, you need the implementation of the EXPath
Packaging System for Saxon[3].  Once this is installed, you can
install the package the usuall way, for instance (you need to adapt
the paths):

    $ xrepo --repo .../repo/dir install .../expath-zip-0.2.xar

  To run the sample, which list and extract the entries in a sample
ZIP file, use the saxon script provided by the EXPath Packaging
System:

    $ saxon --repo .../repo/dir -xsl:sample/entries.xsl -it:main
    $ saxon --repo .../repo/dir --xq sample/entries.xq

  If you need assistance, want to report a bug or discuss the module
design or implementation, you can join the mailing list[4].
